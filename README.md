# TMP-ResDistancePre# privateCode
### SurResD is a deep learning model based on the combination of Squeeze-and-Excitation(SE) block and Residual Block to predict the distance of residues on the surface of transmembrane protein.  
 
###TMResD is a deep learning model based on residual network, which is used to predict residue distance in transmembrane region of transmembrane protein.
