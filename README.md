# TMP-ResDistancePre
###SurResD is a deep learning model based on the combination of Squeeze-and-Excitation(SE) block and Residual Block to predict the distance of residues on the surface of transmembrane protein.  
###TMResD is a deep learning model based on residual network, which is used to predict residue distance in transmembrane region of transmembrane protein.  
####The input feature is a combination of HHM and CCM, calculated by HHBilts tool and CCMpred algorithm respectively.
