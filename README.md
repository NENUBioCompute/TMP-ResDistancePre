# TMP-ResDistancePre
### SurResD is a deep learning model based on the combination of Squeeze-and-Excitation(SE) block and Residual Block to predict the distance of residues on the surface of transmembrane protein.  
### TMResD is a deep learning model based on residual network, which is used to predict residue distance in transmembrane region of transmembrane protein.  
#### Both networks use feature which is a combination of HHM and CCM as input. HHM and CCM are calculated by HHBilts tool and CCMpred algorithm respectively. The output is the LxL residual-distance matrix
